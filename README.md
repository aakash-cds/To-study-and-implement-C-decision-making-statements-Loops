# 🔁 Experiment 6 – C++ Decision Making Statements with Loops

## 🎯 Aim:
To study and implement decision-making statements along with different types of loops in C++, and solve problems such as pattern generation using nested loops.

---

## 📚 Theory:

Decision-making and looping are fundamental building blocks in C++. They allow programs to make choices and repeat actions, making them dynamic and interactive.

### ✅ Decision-Making Statements:
- `if`, `else`, `else if`: Used to control the flow based on conditions.

### 🔁 Looping Constructs:
- `for` loop: Executes a block of code a fixed number of times.
- `while` loop: Repeats a block as long as the condition is true.
- `do-while` loop: Similar to `while`, but guarantees at least one execution.

### ✨ Nested Loops:
Used when looping inside another loop; essential for 2D problems like patterns.

---

## 🧪 Procedure:
1. Start with `#include <iostream>` and `using namespace std;`
2. Declare required variables.
3. Use `for`, `while`, or `do-while` loops as per pattern logic.
4. Use conditional statements when required to control flow.
5. Compile and run the program.
6. Observe the output and verify correctness.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered:
- Conditional logic using `if`, `else if`, `else`
- Nested `for` loops for row and column traversal
- Controlling spacing and symmetry in patterns
- Combining decision-making with loop constructs

---

## 📈 Learning Outcomes:
- Gained hands-on experience with `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- Learned to apply conditionals for controlling logic flow.
- Understood how to use nested loops for creating pattern-based outputs.
- Strengthened skills in logic building and syntax fluency.

---

## ✅ Sample Template
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n = 5; // height of pattern
    // add loop logic here
    return 0;
}
```
